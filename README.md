# GTA5-TikTok-Integration
GTA5 Plugin to control GTA5 via Webhook events from TikTok Live. You need TikFinity (https://tikfinity.zerody.one/) to setup Webhooks on certain events.

## Installation
- Make sure that GTA5 is not running.
- Download the latest plugin version from the [releases](https://github.com/smeysu/GTA5-TikTok-Integration/releases).
- Extract the downloaded ZIP archive.
- Copy all files and folders into your GTA 5 installation directory (The directory where the **GTA5.exe** is located).<br>
  The default installation directory is: `C:\Program Files\Rockstar Games\Grand Theft Auto V`<br>
  If you get it through Steam, the path is: `E:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Grand Theft Auto V` (The drive letter can vary)
- Restart GTA5 and start playing in offline/story mode.
- You can check if the plugin is running by opening http://127.0.0.1:6721/ in your browser.<br>If everything is working you will get the message `Its working!`.

Please note that the plugin installation may need to be repeated after a GTA5 update, since the GTA5 update process overwrites all files.
